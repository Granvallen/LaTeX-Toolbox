Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence in order to establish matching images. In this work, we formulate stitching as a multi-image matching problem, and use invariant local features to ﬁnd matches between all of the images. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the input images. It is also insensitive to noise images that are not part of a panorama, and can recognise multiple panoramas in an unordered image dataset. In addition to providing more detail, this paper extends our previous work in the area [BL03] by introducing gain compensation and automatic straightening steps.},

The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) solution, which is widely applied in BA problems, requires more linear equation solution and more iterations. A gain matrix calculated using both the Jacobian matrix and residual vector replaces the simple diagonal matrix of the LM solution, which results in a better estimation of the descent direction and step size when ﬁnding a path to a local minimum in a sparse BFGS solution. Four datasets were veriﬁed, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method requires fewer linear equation solutions to converge to a minimum compared with that of the LM-based BA method.},

	abstract = {We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions of the projective model are not fully satisﬁed by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justiﬁed when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with signiﬁcantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a method to construct seamless image mosaics of a panoramic scene containing two predominate planes: a distant back plane and a ground plane that sweeps out from the camera’s location. While this type of panorama can be stitched when the camera is carefully rotated about its optical center, such ideal scene capture is hard to perform correctly. Existing techniques use a single homography per image to perform alignment followed by seam cutting or image blending to hide inevitable alignments artifacts. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use two homographies per image to produce a more seamless image. Speciﬁcally, our approach blends the homographies in the alignment procedure to perform a nonlinear warping. Once the images are geometrically stitched, they are further processed to blend seams and reduce curvilinear visual artifacts due to the nonlinear warping. As demonstrated in our paper, our procedure is able to produce results for this type of scene where current state-of-the-art techniques fail.},

	isbn = {978-1-4799-5118-5},
	abstract = {Parallax handling is a challenging task for image stitching. This paper presents a local stitching method to handle parallax based on the observation that input images do not need to be perfectly aligned over the whole overlapping region for stitching. Instead, they only need to be aligned in a way that there exists a local region where they can be seamlessly blended together. We adopt a hybrid alignment model that combines homography and content-preserving warping to provide ﬂexibility for handling parallax and avoiding objectionable local distortion. We then develop an efﬁcient randomized algorithm to search for a homography, which, combined with content-preserving warping, allows for optimal stitching. We predict how well a homography enables plausible stitching by ﬁnding a plausible seam and using the seam cost as the quality metric. We develop a seam ﬁnding method that estimates a plausible seam from only roughly aligned images by considering both geometric alignment and image content. We then pre-align input images using the optimal homography and further use content-preserving warping to locally reﬁne the alignment. We ﬁnally compose aligned images together using a standard seam-cutting algorithm and a multi-band blending algorithm. Our experiments show that our method can effectively stitch images with large parallax that are difﬁcult for existing methods.},

Our feed-forward network has 10 layers, takes two stacked grayscale images as input, and produces an 8 degree of freedom homography which can be used to map the pixels from the ﬁrst image to the second. We present two convolutional neural network architectures for HomographyNet: a regression network which directly estimates the real-valued homography parameters, and a classiﬁcation network which produces a distribution over quantized homographies. We use a 4-point homography parameterization which maps the four corners from one image into the second image. Our networks are trained in an end-to-end fashion using warped MS-COCO images. Our approach works without the need for separate local feature detection and transformation estimation stages. Our deep models are compared to a traditional homography estimator based on ORB features and we highlight the scenarios where HomographyNet outperforms the traditional technique. We also describe a variety of applications powered by deep homography estimation, thus showcasing the ﬂexibility of a deep learning approach.},
